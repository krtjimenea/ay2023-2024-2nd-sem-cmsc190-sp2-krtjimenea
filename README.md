Academic institutions use online learning platforms
for blended learning. As a result, most examinations are
taken online, making it challenging to ensure academic integrity.
This study presents AuthoExam, a proctoring tool that verifies a
student’s digital identity using multi-factor authentication (MFA)
with knowledge and risk-based factors. The Chrome Extension
API was also used to monitor real-time student browser activity.
As a proctoring tool, AuthoExam generated various proctoring
reports that showed and summarized students’ flagged browser
activity during the online exam and their weighted risk score for
risk-based authentication. Ten respondents who have experience
taking or scheduling online exams assessed the proctoring tool’s
usability by answering the System Usability questionnaire. The
average score was 91.75, which indicated that AuthoExam was
has high usability.
